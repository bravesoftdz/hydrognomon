Scientific documentation for Hydrognomon
========================================

In Greek
--------

``hydrognomon-theory-greek.doc``, edited in 2009, contains mostly all
the theory for Hydrognomon.

In English
----------

Around 2012 there was an effort to translate the theory to English.
Different chapters were assigned to different translators. This work
is mostly, but not entirely, complete. The files in this directory
(except ``hydrognomon-theory-greek.doc``) contain these translations.
They may have some duplicate stuff or something might be missing. They
should be reviewed and assembled into a single report.

Copyright and license
---------------------

The GPLv3 license is for the software only; it does not apply to the
documentation. The license for the documentation needs reviewing and
reconsideration. We think that, after the work is completed, there
should be no problem in releasing the documentation under a free
license.

The copyright belongs mostly to the National Technical University of
Athens; small parts may belong to other authors, however.
